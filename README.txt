Purpose:
I wanted to practice scraping data from a website so I created this pokemon information scraper. 
My goal was to be able to get the information even if I do not have an API for the application.
I have had to do similar things at work so I wanted to practice.

To run this application, you will want to use "python ScrapeMain.py" or by running ScrapeMain.py in your GUI.


ScrapeMain.py contains a few variables to keep in mind.

start_pokemon = 1
last_pokemon = 1043  

These 2 variables are "ids" and are what help find pokemon in the "pokedex".

It currently fails at 1043 because I haven't coded the correct scraping method for this type of pokemon.
This will be my next goal.
